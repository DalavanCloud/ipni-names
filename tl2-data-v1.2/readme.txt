General Information
-------------------

The raw data for TL-2 is available in two formats: Text and XML. Contained in this zip file 
are two folders of information, one for each format. In each folder are 15 files named
by TL-2 Volume or Supplemental Volume (e.g., TL_2_Vol_2.txt or TL_2_Suppl_7.xml).

The text files are separated by "PAGE" and "HEADING" headers and correspond to the pages of
content in the volumes that contain botanist information. Introductory and auxillary content
from the original volumes is not provided. The two indexes in each volume are also included 
in both Text and XML files, however they are unparsed in the XML files and may be of limited 
use.

The XML files are structured according to the provided taxonomic-literature.xsd. Generally,
Authors contain Sections of unparsed information and Titles of publications. Author names
are not parsed into subfields, whereas Titles of publications are nominally separated into
subfields.

Please be aware that as we continue to parse this data that these files are subject to
change in the future. The version number and date are indicated below to assist you in
identifying when new content is available.

Version: 1.1
Date: May 17, 2012
