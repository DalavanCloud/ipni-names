# ipni-names

Mapping between names in the International Plant Names Index (IPNI) [http://www.ipni.org] names and bibliographic identifiers.

Names and publications are mapped to a series of bibliographic identifiers, including DOIs, article identifiers from (BioStor)[http://biostor.org], (JSTOR)[http://jstor.org], and (CiNii)[http://ci.nii.ac.jp], Handles, URLs, and PDFs.

Individual pages may also be mapped to BHL PageIDs.

This repository stores the current mapping for a subset of journals, these are in the journals folder as tsp (tab separated value) files. 

## Browser

There is a simple PHP script for a genus-level browser of the IPNI data (the full dataset isn't included in this repository).
